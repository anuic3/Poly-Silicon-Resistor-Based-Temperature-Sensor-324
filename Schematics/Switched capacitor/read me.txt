The entire schematic of the switched capacitor is in the file name "Switchedcapacitor.sch".
80pf capacitance is used for the design."tran.sch" is used to check whether the used MOSFET is giving the capacitance as expected.
AC simulation is done (RC circuit) and a current source is used as input and done the simulation got the expected results
