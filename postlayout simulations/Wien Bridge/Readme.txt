Wb_flat.spice file is the RC extracted file for this module.

Experimental Setup is as follows :

Input : Ac source 
Simulation : Ac simulation is acrried out and the transfer function of output branch current vs input voltage source is plotted.

Expected Ouput : A Bandpass characteristcs is expected having a peak amplitude(Center Frequency) at 250KHz
